# Projrct-Estimation-of-thrust-calculation-using-Afterburner

This project estimates thrust generated by afterburners in aircraft propulsion systems, covering design, fabrication, and
operational principles. It analyzes mission requirements, system architecture, and thermal management crucial for
afterburner efficiency. The study explores the benefits of afterburners, such as increased thrust and performance, and their
drawbacks, including fuel inefficiency and noise. Key performance metrics, including specific impulse and thrust
generation, are evaluated to assess the impact of afterburner technology on overall propulsion performance.
